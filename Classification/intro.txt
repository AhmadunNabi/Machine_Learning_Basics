In this notebook we will use scikit learning action
to perform a decision tree base classification of metadata.
This metadata was curated from sensor data
of a weather station located here in San Diego, California
and the weather station has sensors that capture
weather related measurements such as air temperature,
air pressure, and relative humidity.
